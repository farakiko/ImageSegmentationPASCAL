# ImageSegmentationPASCAL
Image segmentation is a key problem in the field of computer vision with applications such as scene understanding, medical imaging, robot perception, image compression, augmented reality, and many others. Recently, deep learning has been proven success in a wide range of vision applications. In this project, we investigate the use of a fully convolutional network to solve over one of the most popular datasets used for semantic segmentation. The fully convolutional network under investigation is considered the state-of-the-art in image semantic segmentation.
